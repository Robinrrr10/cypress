Cypress
-------
-------

This test execution will directly happens in browser. There is no intermediate like driver or something as like selenium
It will run only in chrome

---


To install cypress use below command:
npm install cypress -save  //It will install cypress package

After installing it will show the command to open cypress window as like below. Use that command
node_modules\.bin\cypress open   //This will open cypress window
There we can find what are all the test available under integration.

Under cypress/integration add our test .js file for adding test
After adding it will show the same test in cypress window

describe is for adding test group
under describe, it is for adding test
Eg:
describe('Test group name', function(){
  it('Test name', function(){
		//Give content here
	}
}



Below is one of sample assertion:

expect(giveValueHere).to.equal(giveActualValueHere);

Eg:
expect(true).to.equal(true);




Below is to open the web page

cy.visit("GiveUrlHere")

Eg:
cy.visit("https://nellaicrafts.in/")




To find any text using contains use  below

cy.contains('Give text here').click()

Eg:
cy.contains('Our Products').click()



To get url:
cy.url()

To check verify endpoint

cy.url().should('include', '/endpoint')

Eg:
cy.url().should('include', '/shop')




To get element using class name:

cy.get('.classname')

Eg:
cy.get('.header-search-icon')



To get element using id:
cy.get('#woocommerce-product-search-field-3')



To click, we use element.click() as like below
Eg:
cy.contains('Our Products').click()
cy.get('.header-search-icon').click()


To type text, we use element.type('give here what wanted to type')
Eg:
cy.get('#woocommerce-product-search-field-3').type('shoe')

To verify typed one is showing or not. We can use like below
cy.get('#woocommerce-product-search-field-3').type('shoe').should('have.value', 'shoe')


To debug and go step and step, use below:
cy.pause()


Eg:

describe('Sample Tests', function(){     //describe is  used to create test group
  it('First Test to open the page', function(){ //it is used create test
    //expect(true).to.equal(true); // just a sample assertion
    cy.visit("https://nellaicrafts.in/") //To open the web page
    cy.pause() //To debug and go step by step by clicking
    cy.contains('Our Products').click() //Used to find the  element using text and then clicking
    cy.url().should('include', '/shop')  //To get current url and to verify the  endpoint
    cy.get('.header-search-icon').click() //To get element using class namd and then clicking
    cy.get('#woocommerce-product-search-field-3').type('shoe').should('have.value', 'shoe') //To get element usind id and type text and verifying whether it shows typed text or // NOTE:

  })
})















--------------


Cypress window:
-------------

cypress window will open after giving open command. It will be something like below

node_modules\.bin\cypress open



Whenever we save the test file, it will automatically run the test

We can see whether it is passing or failing
Pass will be in green
Fail will be in red


It will show every steps 
When clicking the steps we can see the screen during that action
It will show before and after in screen
It will also show where exactly the click action happens
It will also show the reload, redirect and new url calls under each steps
By clicking in step we can inpect the element and action details in consol logs
By adding cy.pause(), we can go step by step execution. This will helps for debugging
In top, it will show the total test pass/fail. it will also show the duration etc

Tutorial 1: Introduction
----------------------
It is designed for modern web application front end testing
It is build using node js and comes with npm package
Only Javascript can be used to write scripts
90% of the coding can be done using inbuild command of cypress
It is designed for front endb. but we can also use for few api automation
It is open source
We can do end to end test using cypress

Cypress directly talks to browser.

Two component of cypress:
1. Test runner: This for install doing setup and also for writing test cases etc
2. Dashboard service: This is to run test, record test, having result of test etc


Important features of cypress:
1. Time traveller: This will have result of test in each time. We can check before and after of each step
2. Real time reload: If we modify the test/script, it will automatically rerun the test
3. Spies, stubs and clocks: This is used to modify the function, changing server responses, timing etc
4. Consistent result: As this is running only on chrome.As this directly talks to browser, the result will be consistent
5. Debugging: We can debug using debugging dev tools
6. Automatic waiting: Cypress internally has some intelligence to wait for page to load completely. There is no need of giving wait seperately
7. Network traffic control: This can be used to control the network calls. If need we can mock the api calls.
8. Screenshots and videos: It capture screenshot and videos during test run
